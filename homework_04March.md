## ðŸŽ Carousel Progress #3-Aya, Evelyn, Ehtisham

We started prototyping with horses verticle movement mechanism. Last week, we were struggling to limit horizontal x-axis (forward) and z-axis (sideway) movement with servos.

This week, we first prototyped with some straws and mini geared DC motor. We attached a straw to the motor, then attached an L shape straw to that straw. See below sketch:

It gets horse up and down, however horizontal movement was still there. Below is the video of trying this out with straws (not good choice as they were not rigid of course):

Then, we started prototyping with the servos, as Prof. Shiloh suggested us to use a movable bracket along with servo's shaft and then use a hole on upper part of carousel, just big enough for the rod
(holding the horse) to pass through. This time we decided to use wood pieces and wooden chopsticks instead of straws. This video shows Evelyn impressively managing to drill a hole in chopstick:

This is the setup we made:

This is the videos showing us struggling with getting exact measure, like chopstick's length and servo shaft extender's length, etc.:

The below video shows it working, but verticle movement is did not seem enough to us, and if we are to increase it, we need some deep wooden piece in the ground. And if we are to go with a deep piece, 
it might be a problem as the weight increase and height of carousel increase.

Then, we thought making the chopstick go in ground may not be necessary if we have that movable bracket and very small hole for the chopstick. In the below video, we are getting some horizpntal 
movement as the hole is big and the upper platform we are using for this prototype is not thick enough.

ANother concern with this design is that if we have 6 or 8 horses, we will to power 6-8 servos and neopixels with thin wires of slip ring. They may not be able to supply that much current to the servos and
neo pixels. So, before trying this with our actual platform and exact hole, we want to see if we get one servo to move two horses:
