# Themes for the class clock:

### 1) Golden Sands:
The clock design features a vast expanse of golden sands with occasional palm trees swaying in the breeze. The sun (with leds behind) will move over the clock
to indicate time, with its brightness (and colors) change according to the time of the day. At night, moon takes its place and moves across the clock to indicate time. 
The sand background, at night, also changes color to show moonlight.

### 2) Dhow and Waves:
Daytime: The clock showcases a seascape with traditional dhows sailing on calm waters. The clock hands could be replaced by miniature dhows, moving to indicate the time.
Nighttime: The scene transitions to a moonlit ocean, and the clock hands transform into  waves. Soft reflections on the water highlight the nighttime hours.

### 3) Arabian Nights:
The clock features a bustling market scene inspired by UAE folklore, with characters from local tales and legends. Iconic characters like "Juha" and
"Umm Duwais", or certain mythical elements, places, etc. could be depicted. The sun in the day and moon in the night, shaped like a mystical symbol from folklore, 
moves across the sky to indicate the time. We can also incorporate interactive elements, like for certain hour(s) only a certain character appears, and
touching that character (or pressing some button) would narrate its short story.
